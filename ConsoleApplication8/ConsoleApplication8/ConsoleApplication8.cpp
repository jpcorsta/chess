Hello! Ultimately I don't care what you use this for. It's intended to be
educational, and perhaps to the oddly minded - a little bit of fun.
Please hack this, change it and use it in any way you see fit. You acknowledge
that I am not responsible for anything bad that happens as a result of
your actions. However this code is protected by GNU GPLv3, see the license in the
github repo. This means you must attribute me if you use it. You can view this

Cheers!

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
If you've seen any of my videos - I like to do things using the windows console. It's quick
and easy, and allows you to focus on just the code that matters - ideal when you're
experimenting. Thing is, I have to keep doing the same initialisation and display code
each time, so this class wraps that up.

Usage:
~~~~~~
This class is abstract, so you must inherit from it. Override the OnUserCreate() function
with all the stuff you need for your application (for thready reasons it's best to do
this in this function and not your class constructor). Override the OnUserUpdate(float fElapsedTime)
function with the good stuff, it gives you the elapsed time since the last call so you
can modify your stuff dynamically. Both functions should return true, unless you need 
the application to close.
